			Story Text																						
			You may have noticed several people throughout town with the Lesson Quest icon over their head. You should feel free to travel around town and speak with these individuals to see what you may learn.\n\nHowever if you feel are ready to join the fray of combat then I have a task for you. To the northeast of here, near the edge of the village, is a sounder of wild boars that have been slowly accumulating over the past few days. These creatures are aggressive in nature and have been attacking anyone drawing too close. They must be dealt with and cleared from this area.\n\n I have marked your map with the location of the boars so that you may find them and reduce their numbers. When you have finished, I would like you to report to Gythja of Tor, who can be found north of me, along the road to lower Hafheim. This location is also marked on your map and will be available when you finish my first task.
