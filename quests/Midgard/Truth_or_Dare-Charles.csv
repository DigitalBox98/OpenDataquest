			Charles says, « Hello there, <Class>. Have you ever gotten tired of playing the same game over and over ? That’s what it’s like here. All the adults say we can do is sit here and play ‘Truth or Dare’. Sure, it was fun at first, but most of us have gotten bored and Raymond’s too chicken to do any of the dares I think for him. »\n\nCharles says, « It was a lot more fun when we could play ‘Spin the Elixir’ in the tavern basement with the girls, but Tiff’s parents caught us there and we’ve been treated like babies ever since. I bet this game would be a whole lot better if you could [join] us. I’d even kick Raymond out and think up the bestest dare evern just for you. »		Source Text	Charles says, « Hmmm. Give me a minute. I know just the thing. The guards keep talking about a big, scary statue in the demon dungeon beyond the limit of the town. I dare you to go in and touch it, and come back out without getting eaten by a monster ! What do you say ? »		Charles says, « You made it back alive ! I mean, uh, welcome back ! How was the statue ? »
