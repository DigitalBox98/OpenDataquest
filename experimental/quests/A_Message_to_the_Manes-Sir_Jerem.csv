			It heartens me to know that I can count on your help. Because we cannot devote many resources to dealing with the demons, the first part of my plan calls for us to deliver a warning message to these demons.\n\nOur scouts have reported that two kinds of demons, the Grumoz and the Manes, have ventured outside the portal. Slay two of the Manes to show the demon princes that Albion will not suffer their presence in its lands.\n\nThe Darkness Falls portal is to the east of Prydwen Keep, beyond the bridge. If you have trouble locating it, don't forget that it is marked on your map.		Y Loc	52765	0	0	0

			You've returned! I must admit, <Player>. I was beginning to get a little worried. Were you able to kill the two Manes demons?\n\nWell done! I'll have my scouts monitor the area around the portal in the coming days to see if your actions had the intended effect. I'd be a fool to believe they would give up easily, but at least they will know that we are aware of their presence.\n\nThank you again for all your help. I wish I could offer you a greater payment for your services, but as it is, our gold is stretched thin. Please accept this money along with the thanks of the people of Prydwen Keep.

			Hello again, <Class>. Pardon me for not taking note of your presence earlier, but I've been considering how best to approach a new problem. Albion has no lack of enemies, and we must be vigilant in our defence against each.\n\nThe forces of Midgard, Hibernia, the demons of Darkness Falls, the Drakoran, and Morgana's twisted legions all crave the destruction of our kingdom. So far, we have managed to fend them off, but we cannot count on luck to guide us.\n\nWe have skilled soldirs and commanders, but if our enemies should decide to unite, I fear they would overrun us. The denizens of Darkness Falls have begun to venture beyond the confines of their dungeon. We must act to contain them.
