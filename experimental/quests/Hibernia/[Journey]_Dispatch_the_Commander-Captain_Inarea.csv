			I must admit, was skeptical that you would meet with victory. You seem to be skilled for one so lacking in their seasons.\n\nI have another duty for you, <Player>. One of the utmost importance.		Zone Id	Lamfhota's Sound	Lamfhota's Sound	Lamfhota's Sound

			Story Text																						
			A fine job with the invaders, <Player>. Now that we have regained our foothold and are maintaining a solid defensive position, we can begin to focus on more strategic targets.\n\nFor us to quell this invasion, we cannot simply eliminate the invaders, for they will be quickly reinforced. We must strike at the heart of their invasion force. To the rear of the tower, our sentries have located the Midgard Commander. It is he you must kill, but it will be no easy task.\n\nIn order to dispatch the Midgard Commander, you must first destroy the two elite Huscarls which guard him. Once they are gone, kill the Midgard Commander.\n\nReturn to me when you have completed this task.
