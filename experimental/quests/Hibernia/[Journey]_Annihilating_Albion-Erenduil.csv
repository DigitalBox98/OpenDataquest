			Story Text																						
			I have been observing the invasion force as they've come ashore. It seems that the officers have arrived and have set up their camp beside the dock, to the southwest. Infiltrating the camp to dispatch the commanders will be no easy feat. They are guarded by several sentries and elite Sergeants.\n\nThese Albion fighters are more experienced than the grunt invaders that you vanquished on your way to me. You must take care to protect yourself and not engage too many foes at once. If you are careful, you can lure in the Commander's guards one or two at a time. They're not too bright, after all.\n\nI wish you luck in your task, <Player>. when you have met with victory, report back to Captain Viteri in Fintain.
