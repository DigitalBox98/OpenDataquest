			These Midgard invaders will not relent.They have been pressing their advance and I fear that Captain Inarea and her company of Guardians may soon be overrun. I require your help to enter the fray and dispatch a number of Midgard invaders so that we may gain the advantage before they are able to reinforce.\n\nGo forth and assist any of the Guardians in killing the Midgard invaders. If you prove to be effective, will demonstrate to you our appreciation for your support.\n\nGood luck, <Player>.
