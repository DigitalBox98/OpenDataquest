			Story Text																						
			We have been alerted that Lamfhota's Sound is being invaded by both Albion and Midgard forces and the Albion invaders are drawing near. I can see the crimson red sails of their ships through the trees, to the southwest. Captain Viteri has instructed me to send him qualified fighters to aid in the defense of Fintain.\n\nIcan see that you are progressing in your training, however I will not send you to engage the invaders until lam certain that you are capable of surviving in combat.\n\nThe hills to the northeast are the hunting grounds of the wolf mother Blackfang, and her brood of bloodthirsty wolves. Slaying them will be proot enough that you are prepared to pit yourself against the foes of Albion and Midgard.\n\nwhen you have completed this task, visit Captain Witeri with proof of Blackfang's death. I wish you luck, <Class>.
