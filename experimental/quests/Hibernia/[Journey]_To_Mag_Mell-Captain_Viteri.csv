The experience and abilities which you have gained here are sorely needed in other areas in Hibernia, particularly where the realm war is raging.\n\nThere is more training you must experience before you master the <Class> profession, but there is no question that you are well on your way.\n\nThe many peoples of Hibernia are here to help you, <Player> and there are many adventures that lay ahead.I send you to the capable care of Elder Krenyn, in Hibernia's glorious town of Mag Mell. Channeler Avalloc in lower Fintain will provide you with passage.\n\nThank you, <Player>. You will not be forgotten.
