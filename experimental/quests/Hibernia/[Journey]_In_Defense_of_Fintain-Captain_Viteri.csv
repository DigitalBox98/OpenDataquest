Be forewarned, these enemies are no foolish monsters. They will attack you if you are seen, even at some distance, so be very careful as you approach them.\n\nWe must thin their numbers, and most importantly, disable their siege weapons.Do what you can on your way to Erenduil.\n\nMay The Morrigan guide your hand in battle, <Class>.
