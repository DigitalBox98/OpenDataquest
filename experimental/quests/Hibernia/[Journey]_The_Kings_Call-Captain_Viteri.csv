			Story Text																						
			I observed your infiltration of the enemy encampment from my position. You seem to have a preternatural ability for dispatching the foes of Hibernia. Fintain is in your debt for helping to protect her shores.\n\nThe forces of Midgard have launched an offensive on our stronghold, Dun Cormyra.\nI need you to report to Captain Faltonair as soon as possible. He will need your help to hold back the Midgard invaders there.
