			Story Text																						
			To prepare you for the realm war, we are going to have to get you accustomed to combat as a new <Class>. You may have noticed several people throughout town with the Lesson Quest icon over their head. You should feel free to speak with these individuals if you would like to learn some basic lessons.\n\nIf you do not require these lessons, and wish to delve directly gaining experience in combat, I have just the task for you.\n\nIn the east of my location a population of Wild Crouch have been slowly accumulating. These creatures have been attacking innoncent townsfolk at random, and they must be cleared from the area.\n\nI have marked your map with the location of these creatures so that you may find them and reduce their numbers. When you have finished, I would like you to report to Artigan who can be found northwest of me, along the road to lower Fintain. I have marked this location upon your map as well.
