We are not quite out of the woods, but what remains of the invasion force can be handed by our Cormyra Guardians.\n\nCaptain Viteri has been eagerly awaiting a dispatch from Dun Cormyra. He has been coordinating the defense against the Albion invasion force and he will be pleased to hear that the keep defense is going well.\n\nEkim has been stationed here to evacuate guardians critically wounded in defense of the keep. He will provide you with easy passage back to Fintain so that you may deliver the dispatch to Captain Witeri.\n\nThank you and good luck, <Class>.
