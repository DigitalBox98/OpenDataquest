			Story Text																						
			You may have noticed several people throughout town with the Lesson Quest icon over their head. You should feel free to travel around town and speak with these individuals to see what you may learn.\n\nIf you are ready to become prepared for combat in our war torn land, however, I have a task for you. To the northeast of my location a population of small black bears have been slowly accumulating. These creatures have been attacking innocent townsfolk at random, and they must be cleared from the area.\n\nI have marked your map with the location of these creatures so that you may find them and reduce their numbers. When you have finished, I would like you to report to Lieutenant Cantren who can be found north of me, along the road to lower Holtham.
