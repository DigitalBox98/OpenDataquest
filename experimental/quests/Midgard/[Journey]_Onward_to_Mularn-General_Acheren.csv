Do you wish to leave Grenlock’s Sound ? It is within my power to send you to Mularn if you would like. The distance is quite far and would take an entire day by horse. A travel spell is the fastest and safest way to get there. »	Channeler Olofsven says, « Very well then. You will be able to return here until you have reached your 16th season of training. Speak to any of the other Channelers of the realm to travel back. Are your ready to leave now ? »

			Story Text																						
			Yes, Hafheim is at your service, but you are meant for service to the entire realm of Midgard. I am going to send you to Chieftain Feidrid, once a legendary warrior who commanded our armies on the frontier. He’s recently taken up residence in Mularn and is training our most promising new recruits for this unceasing realm war.\n\nPlease see Channeler Olofsven in the center of Hafheim, by the Bindstone, and he will give you passage to Mularn.\n\nMidgard is an impressive realm, <Player>, spanning leagues and we need someone to do their part in defending its borders. Farewell and may the gods go with you.
