			Story Text																						
			We have been alerted that Grenlock’s Sound is being invaded by obth Albion and Hibernian forces and the Hibernian invaders are drawing near. I can see the emerald green sails of their ships through the trees, to the southwest. General Acheren has instructed me to send him qualified fighters to aid the defense of Hafheim.\n\nI can see that you are progressing in your training, however I will not send you to engage the invaders until I am certain that you are capable of surviving in combat.\n\nThe hills to the north are the hunting grounds of the wolf mother Blackfang, and her brood of bloodthirsty wolves. Slaying them will be proof enough that you are prepared to pit yourself against the foes of Albion and Hibernia.\n\nWhen you have completed this task, visit General Acheren with proof of Blackfang’s death. I wish you luck, <Class>.
