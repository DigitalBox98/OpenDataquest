			Story Text																						
			Our forces have regained their foothold out here of the tower, thanks in part to your bravery and skill. My concern is for Thorsa Faste and the noble Jarl who resides there.\n\nJarl Thorsa has long defended Grenlock’s Sound, and the village of Hafheim by keeping the forces of Albion and Hibernia at bay. This simultaneous invasion is bringing Thorsa Faste to the brink of capture and that would be disastrous for the realm of Midgard.\n\nFollow  the path south and enter the courtyard of Thorsa Faste. Slay all the Armsmen that you fins. Show them no mercy, <Class>, for the safety of the realm is at stake. Once you have bewn down the invaders, speak to Lieutenant Heitrir who stands guard over the last remaining barrier between the heathens of Albion and our noble Jarl Thorsa, she will grant you access to the inner keep.
