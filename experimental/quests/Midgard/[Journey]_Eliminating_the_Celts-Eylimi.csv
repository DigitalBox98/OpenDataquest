			Story Text																						
			I have been observing the invasion force as they’ve come ashore. It seems that the officers have arrived and have set up their camp beside the dock, to the southwest. Infiltrating the camp to dispatch the commanders will be no easy feat. They are guarded by several sentries and elite Sergeants.\n\nThese Hibernian fighters are more experienced then the grunt invaders that you vanquished on your way to me. You must take care to protect yourself and not to engage too many fooes at once. If you are careful, you can lure in the Commander’s guards one or two at a time. They’re not too bright, after all.\n\nI wish you luck in your task, <Player>. When you have met with victory, report back to General Acheren in Hafheim.
