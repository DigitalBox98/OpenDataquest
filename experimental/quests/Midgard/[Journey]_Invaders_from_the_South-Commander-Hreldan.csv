			These Albion invaders will not relent. They have been pressing their advance and I fear that my company of Huscarts may soon be overrun. I require your help to enter the fray and dispatch a number of Albion invaders so that we may gain the advantage before they are able to reinforce.\n\nGo forth and assist any of the Huscarls in killing the Albion invaders then report to Captain Torrek. If you prove to be effective, he will demonstrate to you our appreciation for your support.\n\nGood luck, <Player>.
