			Story Text																						
			I observed your infiltration of the ennemy encampment from my position. You seem to have a preternatural ability for dispatching the foes of Hibernia. Hafheim is in your debt for helping to protect her shores.\n\nThe forces of Albion have launched an offensive on our stronghold, Throsa Faste. I need you to report to Commander Hreldan as soon as possible. He will need your help to hold back the Albion invaders there.
