			Clear the path over the marsh to Thidranki. Kill at least 5 zephyr nymphs and return to Captain Giberun.		Source Text	I’m glad to see you <Player>. We’ve been running supplies back and forth to Caer Claret for some time now. The siege fairs well for us, but we ve run into problems with the zephir nymphs. Those fighty little creatures are intent on stealing and looting our caravans. <Player> can I task you with clearing the path for our caravans to Claret ? 	Rhedoc says, "Don't think that he wouldn't! Since his wife passed away, Gwyneth is everything to him. He makes her stay upstairs when the apprentices are around, and with good reason. Imagine what it would be like if every apprentice lost his [heart] to her."\nRhedoc flashes an awkward smile.	Rhedoc says, "I can't approach her directly, but I've written a poem to express my feelings to her. The only problem is that I haven't figured out a way to deliver it anonymously. I want her to read it and know who I am, but I'm afraid she won't like it, or me. I'll gladly pay you if you would be willing to deliver it for me."\n\nWill you [help] Rhedoc win Gwyneth's heart?	Rhedoc says, "I've seen her walking with him in the evening. He's one of the most promising apprentice weaponsmiths and the son of one of the other tradeskill Guildmasters. I don't know if he's courting her, but I wouldn't be surprised. If you see Daemyr, please don't mention my name. It's bad enough that he and the other apprentice weapon- and armorsmiths tease me for my choice of profession. 'What's the matter, are you too weak to lift a hammer?' they say. Sometimes they ask if my embroidery is the secret weapon that will give Hibernia the edge in this miserable war. Anyway, thank you again for agreeing to help me. Please return to me after you have delivered the [poem]."	Rhedoc says, "You probably don't believe in love at first sight, and I didn't, either, at the time."	Rhedoc says, "I want to get to know her better, but I don't think a beautiful Elf from a well-to-do family would be interested in me."	Rhedoc grins.	Rhedoc says, "That's great! Let me find it for you".	Rhedoc says, "Gwyneth lives with her father, Armin, in Tir na Nog. I've heard that she likes to visit the Green Rose Pub, so you may be able to find her there. Please do not mention the errand to anyone else.	Rhedoc says, "I've seen her walking with him in the evening. He's one of the most promising apprentice weaponsmiths and the son of one of the other tradeskill Guildmasters. I don't know if he's courting her, but I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nIf you see Daemyr, please don't mention my name. It's bad enough that he and the other apprentice weapon- and armorsmiths tease me for my choice of profession. 'What's the matter, are you too weak to lift a hammer?' they say. Sometimes they ask if my embroidery is the secret weapon that will give Hibernia the edge in this miserable war. Anyway, thank you again for agreeing to help me. Please return to me after you have delivered the poem."	Gwyneth says, "Hello. I don't recognize you, Guardian. Are you looking for my father, Armin?" Gwyneth says, "You're not? Then what brings you here?" 		You hand Gwyneth the poem and she glances at the seal, not recognizing it. She eagerly unfolds the poem, reading quickly. As her eyes move down the page, the corners of her mouth begin to fall. She does not quite frown, but it is clear that she had different expectations. 	Gwyneth says, "I can't think of who might have sent such a thing."	…	You tell Gwyneth that her father's apprentice, Rhedoc, wrote her the poem and asked you to deliver it to her.		Rhedoc appears as though he might have had more to say, though he stops speaking abruptly. He takes a moment to compose himself and then continues.\n\nRhedoc says, "So, she rejected me for Daemyr? Can't she see that I'm not the sniveling coward Daemyr calls me? I would treat her as a lady deserves to be treated.	Rhedoc appears as though he might have had more to say, though he stops speaking abruptly. He takes a moment to compose himself and then continues. 	Rhedoc says, "I have a friend in Tir na Nog who is training to be a spellcrafter. Occasionally, he brings me a prototype of something that he's working on. When I told him about my dilemma, he gave me a [magical orb] to help me decide what to do."

			Thank you <Player>. Accept this coin and experience as reward for your hard work here today.		Target Text	I was lucky enough to be chosen as one of his apprentice tailors and I'd hate to be sent away because I fell in love with his daughter, [Gwyneth].	Rhedoc says, "Don't think that he wouldn't! Since his wife passed away, Gwyneth is everything to him. He makes her stay upstairs when the apprentices are around, and with good reason. Imagine what it would be like if every apprentice lost his [heart] to her."	Rhedoc says, "I just can't help it. It's not like I was trying to get her attention. Well, ok, I never had her attention. She doesn't know how I feel. She doesn't even know who I am. I only found out about her by [accident]." 	As luck would have it, Gwyneth was helping her father finish up an order when I arrived with the scissors. That's when I first [saw her].	You hand Gwyneth the poem and she glances at the seal, not recognizing it. She eagerly unfolds the poem, reading quickly. As her eyes move down the page, the corners of her mouth begin to fall. She does not quite frown, but it is clear that she had different expectations. Gwyneth chuckles nervously when she reads the last of the text.\nGwyneth says, "Thank you...I think. I appreciate the sentiment, but the poem is simply horrible. I don't mean to offend your employer, but I hope he didn't think he'd win my affection with this. He seems to be quite a desperate [man], or did Daemyr put you up to this?"	wyneth says, "I can't think of who might have sent such a thing. Most would-be suitors have the sense to identify themselves, but I can understand why the author of this, er, work might want to remain anonymous. Is it someone that I [know]?"	Rhedoc says, "I can't approach her directly, but I've written a poem to express my feelings to her. The only problem is that I haven't figured out a way to deliver it anonymously. I want her to read it and know who I am, but I'm afraid she won't like it, or me. I'll gladly pay you if you would be willing to [deliver it] for me."	Please promise that you won't break the seal on it. The contents are private, and for Gwyneth's [eyes only]."	Please do not mention the errand to anyone else. Also, be on the lookout for [Daemyr]."		You tell Gwyneth that you have been sent to give her a gift from an anonymous admirer. Gwyneth says, 	A gift for me? How thoughtful! Do you have it with you?	Gwyneth chuckles nervously when she reads the last of the text.\n\nGwyneth says, "Thank you...I think. I appreciate the sentiment, but the poem is simply horrible. I don't mean to offend your employer, but I hope he didn't think he'd win my affection with this. He seems to be quite a desperate [man], or did Daemyr put you up to this?"	Most would-be suitors have the sense to identify themselves, but I can understand why the author of this, er, work might want to remain anonymous. Is it someone that I [know] ? 	Gwyneth says, "What is his [name]?"	 Gwyneth says, "Rhedoc? I've no interest in that oafish Fribolg. Who's ever heard of a Firbolg tailor, anyway? Tell him that if he behaves like this again, I'll ask Father to send him away. Father has no need of apprentices with designs on his daughter."\n\nGwyneth shudders with disgust as she imagines life with Rhedoc and then snorts in disdain at the idea of a Firbolg tailor.	Rhedoc says, "Ah, you're back! Did you deliver my poem to [Gwyneth]?"	I'd make the finest dresses for her. She shouldn't be trapped in a [marriage] with that lying bully!"	Rhedoc says, "I-I'm sorry, <Player>. I let my feelings get the better of me. I let myself believe for too long that it was going to be just like the story of Cuchulain and Emer. I know you did your best, and without your help, I'd still love a woman who didn't [love] me. Thank you again for your help"	Rhedoc says, "Here it is. I'd like you to have it as a reward for all your hard work. I'm sure Adnil will craft me another one, and perhaps, in time, I won't need it to make my decisions for me."
